# Project Overview 🍪

Who doesn't love Girl Scout cookies? This project dives into the delicious world of cookie sales, where I created and cleaned a custom dataset to answer 20 of the biggest questions about what makes these treats sell like hotcakes! Here’s a taste of the journey so far:

### Project Files
- **Dataset**: [Cookie Sales CSV](https://github.com/Meccamarshall/DataAnalytics/blob/main/Girl%20Scout%20Project/Cookie_sales.csv)
- **SQL Analysis**: [Girl Scout Analysis SQL File](https://github.com/Meccamarshall/DataAnalytics/blob/main/Girl%20Scout%20Project/SQL)

### Data Creation and Cleanup 🧹
After generating the initial dataset, I rolled up my sleeves to clean it up, scrubbing duplicate entries, ensuring each cookie name was correct (because "ThinMints" or "Thin Mints"? Only one can rule!), and tidying up dates so every crumb was in the right place.

### Cookie Sleuthing with SQL 🔍

- **Mixing up Functions**: We whipped up `SUM`s and `AVG`s to uncover total and average sales insights (spoiler: Thin Mints took the lead!).
- **Top Region and Cookie Rankings 🏆**: With window functions, we crowned the **Northeast** as the top region, boasting the highest number of orders at **1,362 units**, with **Thin Mints** reigning as the top cookie.

## Tasty Takeaways

- 🍫 **All Hail Thin Mints!** They reign supreme as the best-selling cookie, with peak cravings (and sales!) around the holidays.
- **Northeast Knows Best**: The Northeast region topped the charts with the highest number of orders.
