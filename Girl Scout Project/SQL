-- Who can resist the charm of Girl Scout cookies? For this project, I’m using a custom Girl Scout cookie sales dataset, created with the help of ChatGPT, to dive deep into the delightful world of cookie sales analytics! This dataset is packed with everything a cookie fan could dream of—sales regions, cookie varieties, customer quirks, and troop dynamics—perfect for exploring twenty key insights. Using SQL, I’ve tackled questions like which cookies dominate each region, which age groups are most loyal to their favorite flavors, and how payment preferences reveal unique customer behaviors. This project blends data with fun as I uncover trends and patterns in everyone’s favorite treats, all while leveling up my SQL skills. Analyzing cookie sales has never been this exciting!
